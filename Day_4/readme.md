Project: Make a vacation planning agent where user mentions a city and number of days he wishes to go on vacation there and agent generates a travel itinerary. LLM should tell the information about city from this document. If city doesnâ€™t exist in document it should not proceed further. It should use a flight info api to get flight information. It should use a weather api to get weather of that city. It should then generate a budget and ask user if it wants to proceed. If user says to proceed in natural language, it should return a detailed itinerary with flight information. Itinerary should only have data from document and no further information.
